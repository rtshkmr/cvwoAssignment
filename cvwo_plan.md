- MVC patterns

Database: - SQL - primary key - foreign key - Entity-Relationship Diagram - relation cascading

HTML, CSS, JavaScript:

React: - components, composable components

## == ACTUAL TASKS ==

2. Planning Diagrams:
   - Write up on Basic Use cases and execution plan. Just a report on things,
     include suggestions and problems faced...

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Overall Aims: - website dev cycle (CVWO is one development cycle) - learning proper code structure, techniques and familiarity w tools

## Required Understanding

1. Ruby on Rails

   - reusable boilerplate code
   - Puma and SQLite

2. Relational Database and database basics:

   - tables related to each other through foreign keys
   - Usually,an application will use one database, with several applications
     sharing the same database server.
   - Schema:
     . blueprint for tables, about their structure and relationships
   - Rows contain actual values, need to have a Primary Key that is unique for every row
   - Foreign key must map into the primary key column set of another table

3. JavaScript
   - need beautiful JS
   -
4. React
   - Js library to build UIs.
   - components: module that renders some output
   - you can compose components and create a hierarchy of sorts
